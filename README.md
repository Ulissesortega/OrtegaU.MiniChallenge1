# OrtegaU.MiniChallenge1
This program request the user to enter his name, if is empty will say there was no name and ask the user to run the program again Yes or No

Program looks good the code looks simple and clean. In adition to adding data vaildation for the yes or no (if the user wants to play again ) Ulieses also added another source of vaildation. He added an extra line to make sure the user didnt enter in return without typing in anything. I also praise him for making changing the users response to upper. That way you would only need to check if the user typed in yes or no for the last part of the data validation(if they want to play again.)
